        <h1>Mission</h1>
        <p>LocalFridge was started by Justin Timko in 2017. The goal of LocalFridge
          is to address the hunger and waste problem happening right now all around.
          The plan is to set up a safe and interactive community to share food amonst
          each other, rather than letting it go to waste. LocalFridge is a digital
          community garden currently located in Solano County, and planning to expand.</p>
        <p>Exchanges are currently through email. Over time we will provide a messaging
          system, along with a ranking system to give users a chance to rank their
          experience with other users. We believe this will help keep a safe community.
          Users are encourage to provide feedback and ideas to expand this community. Contact
          information will be provided at <a href="contact.php">Contact</a>.</p>
        <p>Nothing is to ever be sold. If users are posting on this site, they are
